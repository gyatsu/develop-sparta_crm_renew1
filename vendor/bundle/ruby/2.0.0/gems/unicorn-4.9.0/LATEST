=== unicorn 4.8.3 - the end of an era / 2014-05-07 07:50 UTC

  This release updates documentation to reflect the migration of the
  mailing list to a new public-inbox[1] instance.  This is necessary
  due to the impending RubyForge shutdown on May 15, 2014.

  The public-inbox address is: unicorn-public@bogomips.org
      (no subscription required, plain text only)
  ssoma[2] git archives: git://bogomips.org/unicorn-public
  browser-friendly archives: http://bogomips.org/unicorn-public/

  Using, getting help for, and contributing to unicorn will never
  require any of the following:

  1) non-Free software (including SaaS)
  2) registration or sign-in of any kind
  3) a real identity (we accept mail from Mixmaster)
  4) a graphical user interface

  Nowadays, plain-text email is the only ubiquitous platform which
  meets all our requirements for communication.

  There is also one small bugfix to handle premature grandparent death
  upon initial startup.  Most users are unaffected.

  [1] policy: http://public-inbox.org/ - git://80x24.org/public-inbox
      an "archives first" approach to mailing lists
  [2] mechanism: http://ssoma.public-inbox.org/ - git://80x24.org/ssoma
      some sort of mail archiver (using git)
